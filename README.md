Taking queues from AppStuff's Twitter YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pIXMwvJLZs&t=8182s) to build a functioning Twitter clone using SwiftUI. 

Since some time has passed since the tutorial's release, my TwitterClone app aims to more closely resemble the 2023 Twitter UI. The app uses MVVM architecture and Firebase for server-side authentication and storage.

Additional capabilities:
- <b>Feed:</b> Each Tweet is a NavigationLink to the associated ProfileView
- <b>Edit Profile:</b> User may edit bio, website, and banner image.

Future updates:
- Sign-in with Apple/Google
- Add images to tweets
- Implement Follower/Following logic 
- Retweets and DMs
